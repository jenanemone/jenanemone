## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm, Jennie, a US-based full-stack web developer and software engineer.

#### A little about yours truly:
I started building websites back in the days of Geocities. I spent time working on a research project helping the visually-impaired access maps while at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, known as the [Blind Audio-Tactile Mapping System (BATS)](https://www.python.org/success-stories/python-in-the-blind-audio-tactile-mapping-system/), but after graduation I found myself building an inventory-based wholesale and eCommerce business. For the last 2 years I've been grinding out websites for clients, writing scripts for automating data extraction, and building applications for a variety of tasks.

:star2: My current portfolio site (which needs some TLC and updating as of November 2022) with links to a few other projects: [jenanemone.netlify.app](https://jenanemone.netlify.app)     

:rocket: My current work in progress: a public speaking practice tool: [Imposture demo](https://imposture-production.up.railway.app/)
    
     
I love learning, so I'm always reading docs and tutorials, or talking code with friends and colleagues.

ðŸ§ : At the moment, I'm going deeper on MERN stack, improving my React game and expanding my knowledge of CSS. 

:pushpin: I'm currently working on wrapping up a few client projects and building my own passion projects, but I'm available to collaborate, mentor, discuss a new contract, or in the very near future, to join a team! Let's connect.
